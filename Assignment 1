Problem 1:
a) Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it.
--->

cd ..                              \\Navigate to Home
ls                                 \\List contents of Home
cd                                 \\Head to root directory, don't use cd .. as it will take you to /$. Root is ~$
mkdir LinuxAssignment              \\Permission was denied to had to type "cd" to renavigate to user section


b) Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its contents.
--->

cd LinuxAssignment                 \\Navigate to LinuxAssignment
touch file1.txt                    \\Creates file1.txt
cat > file1.txt                    \\Open file1.txt and add some text and press ctrl+c to close 
cat file1.txt                      \\View contents of file1.txt


c) Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.
--->

cd LinuxAssignment                 \\Navigate to LinuxAssignment
mkdir docs                         \\Creates "docs" directory


d) Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
--->

cd LinuxAssignment                 \\Navigate to LinuxAssignment
cp file1.txt docs                  \\Copies file1.txt into "docs"
cd docs                            \\Head to docs
mv file1.txt file2.txt             \\Renames file1.txt to file2.txt


e) Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to the current user.
--->

cd docs                            \\Head to docs
chmod u=rwx,g=r,o=r file2.txt      \\Changes permission for file2.txt. Read,write and execute for owner and only read permissions for others and group.
chown cdac file2.txt
ls -l                              \\Check owner of the file


f) Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to ensure that all operations were performed correctly.
--->

ls *                               \\Lists all directories and files inside navigated directory


g) Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific word to search).
--->

find . -type f -name "*.txt"       \\Finds type of files with extension .txt in all directories
