Problem 1:
a) Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it.
--->

cd ..                              \\Navigate to Home
ls                                 \\List contents of Home
cd                                 \\Head to root directory, don't use cd .. as it will take you to /$. Root is ~$
mkdir LinuxAssignment              \\Permission was denied to had to type "cd" to renavigate to user section


b) Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its contents.
--->

cd LinuxAssignment                 \\Navigate to LinuxAssignment
touch file1.txt                    \\Creates file1.txt
cat > file1.txt                    \\Open file1.txt and add some text and press ctrl+c to close 
cat file1.txt                      \\View contents of file1.txt


c) Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory.
--->

cd LinuxAssignment                 \\Navigate to LinuxAssignment
mkdir docs                         \\Creates "docs" directory


d) Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
--->

cd LinuxAssignment                 \\Navigate to LinuxAssignment
cp file1.txt docs                  \\Copies file1.txt into "docs"
cd docs                            \\Head to docs
mv file1.txt file2.txt             \\Renames file1.txt to file2.txt


e) Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to the current user.
--->

cd docs                            \\Head to docs
chmod u=rwx,g=r,o=r file2.txt      \\Changes permission for file2.txt. Read,write and execute for owner and only read permissions for others and group.
chown cdac file2.txt
ls -l                              \\Check owner of the file


f) Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to ensure that all operations were performed correctly.
--->

ls *                               \\Lists all directories and files inside navigated directory


g) Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific word to search).
--->

find . -type f -name "*.txt"       \\Finds type of files with extension .txt in all directories
grep "is" -n file1.txt             \\Displays lines with line numbers containing "is" word in file1.txt


h) Display the current system date and time.
--->

date


i) Display IP address of the system. Ping a remote server to check connectivity.
--->

ip addr                             \\Displays IP address of the system
ping 192.168.1.1                    \\Checks connectivity in ms for 192.168.1.1


j) Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory.
--->

sudo apt install zip                 \\Installs Zip in shell
zip -r zipfile.zip docs              \\Creates zipfile.zip containing compressed docs
mkdir docs2                          \\Creates docs2 directory
unzip -d docs2 zipfile.zip           \\Unzips created zipfile into docs2 which includes docs


k) Open file1.txt in text editor and add some text to it. Replace a specific word in file1.txt with another word.
--->

vi file1.txt                          \\Opens file1.txt in VI editor
                                      \\Press Esc and I to insert data
                                      \\Press Esc after adding data and type :wq to save and exit
sed -i 's/is/was/g' file1.txt         \\Stream editor in place using substitute command replaces is to was globally in file1.txt



Problem 2:
a) Suppose you have a file named data.txt containing important information. Display the first 10 lines of the file to quickly glance at its contents using a command.
--->

touch data.txt                        \\Creating data.txt
cat > data.txt                        \\Adding important information
head data.txt                         \\Displays first 10 lines of data.txt


b) Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of data.txt using another command.
--->

tail -5 data.txt                      \\Displays last 5 lines of data.txt


c) In a file named numbers.txt, there are series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of this file to analyze the initial data set.
--->

head -15 numbers.txt                  \\Displays first 15 lines of numbers.txt


d) To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display last 3 lines of numbers.txt
--->

tail -3 numbers.txt                   \\Displays last 3 lines of numbers.txt


e) Imagine you have a file named input.txt with text content. Use a command to translate all lowercase letters to uppercase in input.txt and save the modified text in a new file named output.txt
