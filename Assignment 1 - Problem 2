Problem 2:
----------

a) Suppose you have a file named data.txt containing important information. Display the first 10 lines of the file to quickly glance at its contents using a command.
--->

touch data.txt                        \\Creating data.txt
cat > data.txt                        \\Adding important information
head data.txt                         \\Displays first 10 lines of data.txt


b) Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of data.txt using another command.
--->

tail -5 data.txt                      \\Displays last 5 lines of data.txt


c) In a file named numbers.txt, there are series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of this file to analyze the initial data set.
--->

head -15 numbers.txt                  \\Displays first 15 lines of numbers.txt


d) To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display last 3 lines of numbers.txt
--->

tail -3 numbers.txt                   \\Displays last 3 lines of numbers.txt


e) Imagine you have a file named input.txt with text content. Use a command to translate all lowercase letters to uppercase in input.txt and save the modified text in a new file named output.txt
--->

tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < input.txt > output.txt  
                                      \\Translator translates all a-z to A-Z in input file and generates output in a new file named output.txt


f) In a file named duplicate.txt, there are several lines of text, some of which are duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from duplicate.txt.
--->

sort -u duplicate.txt                  \\Displays only unique lines from duplicate.txt
OR
uniq -u duplicate.txt                  \\uniq will only work when duplicate content is adjacent


g) In a file named fruit.txt, there is a list of fruits, but some fruits are repeated. Use a command to display each unique fruit along with the count of its occurences in fruit.txt.
--->

uniq -u -c fruit.txt                   \\Displays unique fruit along with count
