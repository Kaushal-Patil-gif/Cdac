  echo "Hello, World!"
  -----
  bash s1.sh

2. Declare a variable nameed "name" and assign the value "CDAC Mumbai" to it. Print the value of the variable.
->
  vi s2.sh
  -----
  #!/bin/bash
  name="CDAC Mumbai"                            \\remember not to give space after name. It will consider it a command instead of var
  echo "Value of variable name is $name"
  -----
  bash s2.sh

3. Write a shell script that takes a number as inout from the user and prints it.
->
  vi s3.sh

  read num
  echo "Your number is: $num"
  -----

4. Write a shell script that performs addition of two number (e.g., 5 and 3) and prints the result.
->
  vi s4.sh
  -----
  #!/bin//bash
  num1="5" num2="3"
  result=$((num1 + num2))
  echo "Addition of $num1 and $num2 is $result"
  -----
  bash s4.sh

5. Write a shell script that takes a number as input and prints "Even" if it is even, otherwise prints "Odd".
->
  vi s5.sh
  ------
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Enter a number"
  read num
  if [ $(( num % 2 )) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Number is Even"
  else
    echo "Number is Odd"
  fi
  -----
  bash s5.sh

6. Write a shell script that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
->
  vi s6.sh
  -----
  #!/bin/bash
  for num in 1 2 3 4 5 
  do
    echo "$num"
  done
  -----
  bash s6.sh

7.  Write a shell script that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
-> 
  vi s7.sh
  -----
  #!/bin/bash
  num= "1"
  while [ $num -le 5 ];
  do
    echo "$num"
    ((num++))
  done
  -----
  bash s7.sh

8. Write a shell script that checks if a file named "file.txt" exists in the current directory. If it 
does, print "File exists", otherwise, print "File does not exist". 
->
  vi s8.sh
  -----
  #!/bin/bash
  if [ -e file.txt ]; then
    echo "File exists"
  else
    echo "File does not exist"
  fi
  -----  
  bash s8.sh

9. Write a shell script that uses the if statement to check if a number is greater than 10 and 
prints a message accordingly. 
->
  vi s9.sh
  -----
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Enter a number"
  read num
  if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "$num is greater than 10"
  else
    echo "$num is less than 10"
  fi
  -----
  bash s9.sh
  
10. Write a shell script that uses nested for loops to print a multiplication table for numbers 
from 1 to 5. The output should be formatted nicely, with each row representing a number and each 
column representing the multiplication result for that number. 
->
  vi s10.sh
  -----
  #!/bin/bash
  for i in {1..10}
  do 
    for j in {1..5}
      do 
      result=$((i * j))
      echo -n " $result"
    done
  echo
  done
  -----
  bash s10.sh
